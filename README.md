# simple-page-with-login

This is a simple website with sign-up page and log-in page in a grey and white aesthetic.  It validates two forms and saves the user's input to local storage which can then be viewed in the console.  

In terms of validation, the form only checks if each input field has been filled; if a field is left empty it surrounds the indicated field in a red border and shows an error message.  The red border and error message are hidden again when the user clicks on the indicated field.  

This project currently utilizes html, css, and JavaScript.  

Future additions to this project will involve more backend to confirm user's username and password, add additional form validations (such as checking for valid email and password; any content the user puts into the fields is currently accepted as long as the fields are not left empty) in addition to building a functional forum that can be accessed as a member or with a guest login.

Stylization was inspired by early rpg text forums.
