# simple-page-with-login

This is a simple website with sign-up page and log-in page in a grey and white aesthetic.  It validates two forms and saves the user's input to local storage which can then be viewed in the console.  

This project currently utilizes html, css, and JavaScript.  

Future additions to this project involve more backend to confirm user's username and password, tighten up the form validation (which is still minimal) in addition to building a functional forum that can be accessed as a member or with a guest login.

Stylization was inspired by early rpg text forums.
